## main() : displays the menu of options and allows the user to choose

    * Have user input which txt or csv file to analyze
    * Option to display all features
    * scatter_matrix option
    * Allow user to choose which features to plot
    * go to main menu or MLKit()
2. MLKit() - List of ML methods, test-train-split, cross validation
    * Regressions
    * train-test-split and value tuning
    * models and value adjustments with confusion matrix results
    * k-fold cross validation, user specifies k
    * go to main menu or EDA
